\chapter{Proposed Algorithm}
This research proposes a Multi-robot Search with Matroid (MRSM) algorithm, which is an improved version of MRSIS \cite{li2024mrsis}.
The objective is to solve Eq. \eqref{eq:objective-Mat}. The algorithm generates $k$ trajectories for $k$ robots.

MRSM is presented in Alg. \ref{alg:matroid-greedy}.
Line 1 is to initialize the selected edge set $S$.
Lines 2-3 define the objective function and the set of matroidal independence systems, respectively.
Line 5 is the edge initialization. Inspired by Kruskal's algorithm, the initial edge $e^i$ is sampled based on the minimum edge weight.
The main difference between MRSIS \cite{li2024mrsis} and MRSM is lines 11-14.
In MRSIS \cite{li2024mrsis}, the graph $S \cup \{e^*\}$ is transformed into robot trajectories by TSP or MST solver.
In MRSM,  the maximal marginal gain is selected to ensure that $S$ remains spanning trees.
The advantage is that MRSM rules out redundant processes (e.g., solving TSP or constructing MST) which improves the computational time.
The computational complexity of MRSM is $\mathcal{O}(|E|^2)$. On the other hand, the computational complexity of MRSIS is $\mathcal{O}(|E|^2+|E||V|^2)$ for both TSP and MST.

The key innovation of the MRSM algorithm is that it expands spanning trees with matroid property.
Hence, MRSM adopts Kruskal's algorithm since Kruskal's algorithm inherently follows a matroid structure.
In constructing an MST, Kruskal's algorithm selects the edge with the minimum weight from the ground set.
It verifies the adding edge to the solution without generating cycling graphs.
The primary difference between MRSM and Kruskal's algorithm is their objectives.
Kruskal's algorithm seeks to generate a minimum spanning tree while
MRSM discovers a spanning tree that maximizes the objective function under clustering and routing budgets.
