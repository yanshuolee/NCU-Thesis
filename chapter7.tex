\chapter{Conclusions and future work}
This research proposes the CBST tree structure to solve submodular maximization problems subject to budget constraint.
The research is summarized as follows:
First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to span cost-benefit tree outperforming benchmark methods.
Second, due to the $\kappa_c$ of the different tree structure, the theorems show the theoretical guarantees in the different tree structures.
Third, the experiments show that the proposed CBST using GCB algorithm outperforms the benchmark approaches.

The future work of this research is as follows:
First, The CBST using GCB algorithm outperforms the benchmark in search experiments in the empty map.
If there are obstacles in the map, the CBST spanning tree could not have better performance than the other methods.
Second, the GCB with tree structured graph cost function is offline approach.
How to apply adaptive submodularity to tree structures is another research direction.
Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to a static target.
How to extend the proposed algorithm to multiple targets and moving targets is another potential research.
