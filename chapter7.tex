\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
To overcome multi-robot search problems consisting of task allocation, minimal routing and maximal coverage problems, this research proposes the MRSM algorithm.
The clustering and routing constraints are reformulated into the intersection of matroids.
With submodularity and matroid property, MRSM achieves $\frac{1}{3}\widetilde{OPT}$, where $\widetilde{OPT}$ is the optimal performance under the spanning tree structure. 
Experiment results show that MRSM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches regarding ETTD in multi-robot search problems.


The future work of this research is as follows.
First, the multi-robot search with an unknown map could be achieved by map exploration and a robot search approach \cite{Lu2020map}. 
Second, extending the MRSM to plan a trajectory online via adaptive submodularity is another direction \cite{golovin2011adaptive}. 
Third, in EX2, where MRSM does not consistently surpass MRSIS-TSP \cite{li2024mrsis}, exploring the integration of both advantages becomes another viable direction.
