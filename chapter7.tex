\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
To overcome the coverage and task allocation problems, this research proposes the MRSM algorithm.
In addition, the clustering and routing constraints are reformulated into the intersection of matroids.
With submodularity and matroid property, MRSM achieves $\frac{1}{3}\widetilde{OPT}$, where $\widetilde{OPT}$ is an approximately optimal performance under the spanning tree structure.
Experiment results show that MRSM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in multi-robot search problems.

The future work of this research is as follows.
First, MRSM relies on known environments. The multi-robot search with an unknown map can be achieved by map exploration and a robot search approach.\cite{Lu2020map}
Second, MRSM is an offline planning approach. Extending the current approach to plan a trajectory online via adaptive submodularity is another direction.\cite{golovin2011adaptive}
Third, in EX2, where MRSM does not consistently surpass MRSIS-TSP\cite{li2024mrsis}, exploring the integration of both advantages becomes another viable direction.
