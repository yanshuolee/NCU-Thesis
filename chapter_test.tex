%\begin{lemma} \label{lemma1}
%Suppose M is connected, and at least one of those coverage intersect another coverage, and all intersection in the M are covered, then M is completely covered.
%\end{lemma}
%
%\begin{theorem}
%Completely covered with any obstacle.
%\end{theorem}
%
%\begin{proof}
%Suppose  boundary $\partial M \in X$,  and $X = B_{r}$, $B_{r} = \{ y \mid \parallel y - x \parallel < r \in \mathbb{R} \}$, $\bigcup_{a_{i}\notin X}a_{i} \bigcup X$, as $i \in n$, as $n \in \mathbb{R}$ satisfied $lemma~\ref{lemma1}$, then $M \subseteq X$.
